# ODG-Test
Backend using go and Frontend (planned to be done) Using React

Notes about this test overall
- As it turns out, this being my first time using golang ever, i couldn't finish the task in the demanded timeframe
- I havent done any of the Frontend Work, and the Backend Work is Questionable, at best
- Even though i probably wouldn't make the cut, this is a learning opportunity for me.I Thank you for giving me the opportunity

Notes about the Backend Test 
- I use GORM, and postgreSQL
- If you want to test it, you can adjust the connectionString in the DBConfig.go to configure your database connection
- I dont use golang-migrate or pressly because i do not see the use of it just yet for this simple project requirement. Instead, i use Gorm AutoMigrate
